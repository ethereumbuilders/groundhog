# Welcome To Project Groundhog

Hello world!

How much of a social network should live on the blockchain? How much in Whisper? How much on a user's PC? What are the benefits/costs of each approach? What should be the role and use of reputation in such a system?

Project Groundhog seeks to find an answer to these questions. 

Here is a YouTube presentation of the project given by [@lisperati](https://twitter.com/lisperati):
